    "# Regression in Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time series regression** is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables that change over time. In other words, it is a way of **predicting future values of a variable based on its past values and the values of other related variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In time series regression, the dependent variable is a time series, which means that it is **assumed** as a sequence of **observations taken at regular intervals over time**. The **independent variables** can also be time series or other types of variables that are believed to have an impact on the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of **time series regression is to identify the underlying patterns and trends** in the data and use this information to **make accurate predictions about future values of the dependent variable**. This is typically done by fitting a statistical model to the data and estimating the coefficients of the model using a variety of techniques, such as least squares or maximum likelihood estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should distinguish between **time series regression** and **time series forecasting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In **time series forecasting**, the goal is to predict the future values of a variable based on its past values alone.\n",
    "- In **time series regression**, the goal is to predict the past, present or future values of a variable based on its past values and the values of other related variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, time series regression is a type of supervised learning, while time series forecasting is a type of unsupervised learning."

    "## Evaluate Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating a time series regression model involves assessing the model's performance and accuracy in predicting future values of the time series. Next, some common methods for evaluating time series regression models are listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train-test split\n",
    "When training a machine learning model, it's essential to evaluate its performance on data that hasn't been used during training. This is done to avoid overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new data. To achieve this, the original dataset is usually split into a training set and a test set. However, there are cases where a third subset, called the validation set, is added to the mix. Here are the main differences between two popular data splitting strategies: train-test and train-validation-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential issue with the train-test split is that the test set might be too small to provide a reliable estimate of the model's performance. The smaller the test set, the more likely it is that the evaluation metric will be affected by chance. To mitigate this issue, the train-validation-test split is often used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Train-Validation-Test Split\n",
    "\n",
    "The train-validation-test split involves dividing the original dataset into three subsets: a **training set, a validation set, and a test set**. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training and to tune the hyperparameters of the model, and the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model after training and tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the model is evaluated on the validation set after every epoch or after a fixed number of iterations. The hyperparameters of the model are then adjusted based on the performance on the validation set. This process is repeated until the best hyperparameters are found. Once the model has been fully trained and tuned, it is evaluated on the test set to obtain an estimate of its performance on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of the train-validation-test split is that it provides a more accurate estimate of the model's performance on new data. By using a separate validation set, we can ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data. By using a separate test set, we can ensure that the evaluation metric is not biased by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Train-Test Split in time series\n",
    "\n",
    "In time series analysis, a common approach to model evaluation is also to use a train-test split. However, the traditional random train-test split is not suitable for time series data, as it violates the assumption that the data points are independent and identically distributed (iid). In time series data, the order of the data points matters, and the past observations can be used to predict the future ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more appropriate approach for time series data is to use a \"rolling window\" or \"walk-forward\" validation technique. This involves training the model on a portion of the data and testing it on a subsequent portion, sliding the window forward until the entire dataset has been used for testing. This allows for the evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data while maintaining the temporal ordering of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rolling window technique, the size of the test set can be chosen based on the application requirements and the available data. However, a common practice is to use a test set that is large enough to provide a reliable estimate of the model's performance but small enough to allow for multiple iterations of the rolling window approach. The performance metrics are then aggregated over the different iterations to obtain a more robust estimate of the model's performance."

    "### Polynomial features\n",
    "Beside the use o month, year as features, and #passengers as targer, it is also possible to do some increase in the number os features using polynomial features. Polynomial features are a type of feature engineering technique used in machine learning to create non-linear models by adding polynomial terms to the original features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, polynomial features are created by taking the original features of a dataset and raising them to a power. For example, if we have a dataset with one feature $x$, we can create polynomial features by adding a new feature $x^2$. Obviously, we can also add higher order terms like $x^3$, $x^4$, and so on.\n",
    "The general formula for generating polynomial features is as follows:\n",
    "$$(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n) \\rightarrow (1, x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n, x_1^2, x_1x_2, \\dots, x_1x_n, x_2^2, x_2x_3,\\dots, x_n^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of adding polynomial features is to capture non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable. In some cases, the relationship between the features and the target variable may not be linear, and adding polynomial features can help to capture these non-linear relationships. This also increases model flexibility since we are increasing the number of dimensions of the dataset. This increased dimensionality can lead to a more flexible model that can fit more complex relationships. On the other side, it can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data; increased model complexity which can make it harder to interpret the model and identify the most important features; and increased computation time required to train the model, especially if we generate a large number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, polynomial features can be a useful tool for improving the performance of machine learning models when the relationship between the features and the target variable is non-linear."

    "A decision tree algorithm is a predictive modeling tool used in machine learning to identify relationships between input variables and their corresponding output variables. It creates a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, based on a set of rules and data. At each node of the tree, the algorithm chooses the best attribute to split the data into two or more subsets, based on their level of impurity. The attribute that creates the most homogeneous subsets is selected as the best splitter. This process continues recursively, creating more nodes and subtrees, until a stopping criterion is met, such as a predefined maximum depth or a minimum number of samples per leaf. Once the decision tree is built, it can be used to make predictions for new input data by traversing the tree from the root to a leaf node and outputting the corresponding class label or numerical value. Decision trees are easy to interpret and visualize, and can handle both categorical and continuous data.\n",

This is because decision trees are designed to model the relationships between input and output variables based on the patterns observed in the training data.

    "In theory, ARIMA models are the most general class of models for forecasting a time series that can be made \"stationary\" by differencing (if necessary), possibly in conjunction with nonlinear transformations such as logging or deflating.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stationary random variable is one whose statistical properties remain constant over time. A stationary series has no trend, constant amplitude variations around its mean, and wiggles in a consistent manner, i.e., its short-term random time patterns always look the same statistically. The latter condition implies that its autocorrelations (correlations with its own prior deviations from the mean) are constant over time, or that its power spectrum is constant over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A random variable of this type can be viewed (as usual) as a combination of signal and noise, with the signal (if present) being a pattern of fast or slow mean reversion, sinusoidal oscillation, or rapid sign alternation, and possibly a seasonal component. An ARIMA model can be thought of as a \"filter\" that attempts to separate the signal from the noise before extrapolating the signal into the future to generate forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ARIMA forecasting equation for a stationary time series is a linear (i.e., regression-type) equation in which the predictors are lags of the dependent variable and/or lags of the forecast errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Predicted value of Y = \"a constant\" + \"a weighted sum of one or more recent values of Y\" + \"a weighted sum of one or more recent values of the errors\"__\n",
    "\n",
    "So, ARIMA stands for Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average. In the forecasting equation, lags of the stationarized series are called __autoregressive terms__, lags of forecast errors are called __moving average__ terms, and a time series that must be differenced to become stationary is called an \"integrated\" version of a stationary series.\n",
    "\n",
    "An $ARIMA(p, d, q)$ model is a nonseasonal ARIMA model, where:\n",

    "### Making a series stationary\n",
    "\n",
    "Making the time series stationary is the first step in developing an ARIMA model, because the term \"Auto Regressive\" in ARIMA refers to a linear regression model that employs its own lags as predictors. Linear regression models perform best when the predictors are uncorrelated and independent of one another. So, to make the series sationary the most common method is to differentiate it. To put it another way, subtract the previous value from the current value. Depending on the complexity of the series, more than one differencing may be required at times. As a result, the value of $d$ is the smallest number of differencing required to make the series stationary. And $d = 0$ if the time series is already stationary."
