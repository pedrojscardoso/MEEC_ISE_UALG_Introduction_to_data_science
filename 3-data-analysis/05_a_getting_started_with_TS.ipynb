    "$$X = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n],$$\n",
    "where $x_i$ represents the observation at the $i$-th time interval and $n$ is the total number of observations. The time interval can be defined as the interval between two consecutive observations, such as seconds, minutes, days, weeks, months, years etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the mathematical definition of a time series can be represented as a function $X(t)$ that maps each time point $t$ to a corresponding observation $x_t$. Thus, a time series can be written as:\n",

We are interested in predicting future times. For instance, the following time is $t+1$ and the following time is $t+2$. $x_{t+1} = X(t+1)$ and $x_{t+2} = X(t+2)$, respectively, represent the observations at these times.\n",

    "\n",
    "- __Discrete__: Although the phenomena measured by a system can be continuous (for example, the outside temperature is a continuous variable because time can \"span the entire real number line\"), TS data is generated by systems that capture data points at specific intervals (for instance, a temperature sensor can take a new temperature reading every 5 minutes). The measurement interval is usually regular (the data points are evenly spaced in time), but they are frequently irregular.\n",

If you analyze your TS data, in almost all cases, you will notice that data points that are close together in time are more closely related than observations that are further apart.

    "\n",
    "Time series analysis offers a collection of methods for comprehending a dataset better. Perhaps the of the most beneficial way to analyze a time series is to decompose it into its four key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The __level__ component represents the series' starting point if it followed a straight line trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The __trend__ component describes the series' potentially linear, variable, increasing, or decreasing behavior over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The __seasonality__ component identifies the cyclical or recurring patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The __noise__ component represents the optional variation in the observations that the model cannot explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **trend and seasonality are optional, and all time series have a level and noise**, i.e., not all time series have a clear trend or seasonality. Some time series may have a stable level and show no trend or seasonality at all. Similarly, the level and noise components are present in almost all time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **level component** represents the baseline or starting point of the series, while the **noise component** captures the random variation or fluctuations in the data that cannot be attributed to any of the other components (such as trend or seasonality).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the level and noise components are fundamental to any time series analysis, while trend and seasonality are additional components that may or may not be present, depending on the nature of the data being analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A **cyclic time series** is a time series that exhibits repeating patterns that are not of a fixed frequency. For example, a time series that exhibits a cycle of length 12 months but with varying amplitude or frequency would be considered cyclic rather than seasonal. Cyclic patterns are often more difficult to model and forecast than seasonal patterns because they do not have a fixed frequency or amplitude.\n"

    "### Additive and multiplicative time series\n",
    "\n",
    "__Additive__ and __multiplicative__ are two different types of time series models that can be used to describe and forecast data patterns over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **additive time series model** assumes that the value of the series at any given time is the sum of the components of the series, which are typically the trend, seasonal variation, and residual (error) terms. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$y(t) = Trend + Seasonality + Error,$$\n",
    "where $y(t)$ is the value of the series at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additive models are often used when the magnitude of the seasonal variation is relatively constant over time, and the fluctuations in the series are relatively small compared to the overall level of the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a **multiplicative time series model** assumes that the value of the series at any given time is the product of the components of the series, which are typically the trend, seasonal variation, and residual (error) terms. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$y(t) = Trend \\times Seasonality \\times Error$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplicative models are often used when the magnitude of the seasonal variation changes over time, and the fluctuations in the series are proportional to the overall level of the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the choice between additive and multiplicative models depends on the specific characteristics of the time series data being analyzed, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer. It is important to carefully examine the patterns and characteristics of the data and choose the model that best captures the underlying dynamics of the series."

    "\n",
    "#### Univariate time series forecasting\n",
    "- __Univariate time series forecasting__ refers to the process of predicting future values of a __single variable over time__, based on its past values. In other words, it involves analyzing a time series dataset that contains only one variable and using it to make predictions about its future behavior. Univariate time series forecasting methods typically involve identifying the underlying patterns or components of the time series, such as trend, seasonality, and noise, and then using statistical models to make predictions about future values based on these patterns. Some common univariate time series forecasting techniques include exponential smoothing, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, and seasonal decomposition of time series models. These methods can be used to make short-term or long-term forecasts, depending on the nature of the data and the forecasting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, predicting the daily closing price of a stock based on its past prices is a univariate time series forecasting problem. In this case, the time series dataset contains only one variable (the daily closing price of the stock) and the goal is to predict its future values based on its past values."

In other words, it involves analyzing a time series dataset that contains multiple variables and using them together to make predictions about their future behavior. Multivariate time series forecasting methods typically involve identifying the underlying patterns or components of the time series for each variable, such as trend, seasonality, and noise, and then using statistical models that can account for the __interactions among these variables to make joint predictions about their future behavior__. Some common multivariate time series forecasting techniques include vector autoregression (VAR) models, dynamic factor models, and neural network models. These methods also can be used to make short-term or long-term forecasts, depending on the nature of the data and the forecasting problem. Multivariate time series forecasting is often used in fields such as economics, finance, and environmental science, where multiple variables are known to interact and influence each other over time.\n",

    "For example, predicting the daily closing price of a stock based on its past prices and other variables such as the daily closing prices of other stocks in the same industry is a multivariate time series forecasting problem. In this case, the time series dataset contains multiple variables (the daily closing prices of the stocks) and the goal is to predict their future values based on their past values and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, __exogenous variables__ are external variables that are not part of the time series being analyzed, but are believed to have an influence on the dependent variable in the time series. In other words, exogenous variables are considered to be factors that are outside of the system being modeled but still impact the outcome of the system. In time series analysis, exogenous variables are often included in the model as additional predictors or inputs to improve the accuracy of the forecast.\n",

    "- What variables or factors might be influencing the time series that are not included in the data, and how can these exogenous variables be incorporated into the forecasting model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the appropriate forecasting horizon for the problem at hand, and what level of accuracy is required for the forecasted values?\n",
    "\n",
    "- How much data do you have at your disposal, and can you compile it all?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are projections subject to regular revision over time, or must they only be created once and remain unchanged? Forecasts that are updated as new data becomes available frequently produce more precise predictions.\n",

    "- __Irregular time series__: An irregular time series is a type of time series that does not exhibit any specific patterns or trends, and the data appears to be random or unpredictable. Irregular time series are often observed in data that is subject to random noise or measurement errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Event time series__: An event time series is a type of time series that represents the occurrence or frequency of specific events over time.\n",

In this context, there are many applications of time series analysis in a variety of industries, including finance, economics, marketing, and engineering, among others. Here are some examples of time series forecasting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stock prices**: Predicting future stock prices based on historical data can be a challenging task, but it is one of the most popular use cases for time series forecasting. Investors and traders often use time series models to forecast stock prices and make better investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weather forecasting**: Forecasting weather patterns is another common application of time series analysis. Meteorologists use historical data to build models that can predict weather conditions for future time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Energy demand**: Time series forecasting is often used to predict energy demand for power plants, electricity grids, and other energy systems. This information can help energy providers to better plan for future needs and optimize their operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sales forecasting**: Retailers use time series forecasting to predict sales for upcoming periods. This helps them to make better decisions about inventory management, staffing, and marketing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Website traffic**: Online businesses use time series forecasting to predict website traffic and plan for future capacity needs. This can help them to ensure that their websites can handle high levels of traffic during peak periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traffic flow**: Time series models can be used to predict traffic flow on highways and other transportation networks. This information can be used to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Disease outbreaks**: Time series models can be used to predict the spread of infectious diseases based on historical data. This can help public health officials to prepare for outbreaks and take appropriate measures to contain them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fraud Detection**: In finance, anomaly detection can be used to detect fraudulent transactions or unusual activity in financial data. For example, credit card companies may use anomaly detection to identify transactions that are significantly different from a customer's usual spending behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Equipment Monitoring**: In manufacturing, anomaly detection can be used to monitor the performance of equipment and identify potential issues before they cause downtime or failure. For example, sensors on a machine may detect unusual vibrations or temperature changes that could indicate a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cybersecurity**: In network security, anomaly detection can be used to detect unusual traffic patterns or behavior that could indicate a potential cyberattack. For example, an intrusion detection system may monitor network traffic for unusual spikes in activity or unusual connection attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Medical Monitoring**: In healthcare, anomaly detection can be used to monitor patient health data and identify potential health issues. For example, sensors on a patient's body may detect unusual heart rhythms or other indicators that could indicate a potential medical problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traffic Management**: In transportation, anomaly detection can be used to monitor traffic patterns and identify potential issues, such as accidents or road closures. For example, sensors on a highway may detect unusual traffic patterns or slowdowns that could indicate a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of the many applications of time series forecasting. In the remaining section will be looking at some examples with more detail.\n"
