Students will learn the definition of a time series, common notation (including lag times and future predictions), and the characteristics of time series data (sequence, discrete nature, chronological order). The lesson also covers the decomposition of time series into level, trend, seasonality, and noise components, explaining the differences between additive and multiplicative models.

    "A __time series__ (TS) can be mathematically defined as a sequence of observations recorded at (usually) equally spaced intervals of time. Mathematically, a TS can be represented as a vector\n",
    "$$X = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n],$$\n",
    "where $x_i$ represents the observation at the $i$-th time interval and $n$ is the total number of observations. The time interval can be defined as the interval between two consecutive observations, such as seconds, minutes, days, weeks, months, years etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the mathematical definition of a time series can be represented as a function $X(t)$ that maps each time point $t$ to a corresponding observation $x_t$. Thus, a time series can be written as:\n",
    "$$X(t) = x_t,$$\n",

    "\n",
    "- __Discrete__: Although the phenomena measured by a system can be continuous (for example, the outside temperature is a continuous variable because time can \"span the entire real number line\"), TS data is generated by systems that capture data points at specific intervals (for instance, a temperature sensor can take a new temperature reading every 5 minutes). The measurement interval is usually regular (the data points are evenly spaced in time), but they are frequently irregular.\n",

If you analyze your TS data, in almost all cases, you will notice that data points that are close together in time are more closely related than observations that are further apart. Because of this natural ordering, any time series model will typically attempt to learn from past values of a given sequence."

    "### Level, trend, seasonality, and noise\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series analysis offers a collection of methods for comprehending a dataset better. Perhaps, one the of the most beneficial way to analyze a time series is to decompose it into its four key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The __level__ component represents the series' starting point if it followed a straight line trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The __trend__ component describes the series' potentially linear, variable, increasing, or decreasing behavior over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The __seasonality__ component identifies the cyclical or recurring patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The __noise__ component represents the optional variation in the observations that the model cannot explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **trend and seasonality are optional, and all time series have a level and noise**, i.e., not all time series have a clear trend or seasonality. Some time series may have a stable level and show no trend or seasonality at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **level component** represents the baseline or starting point of the series, while the **noise component** captures the random variation or fluctuations in the data that cannot be attributed to any of the other components (such as trend or seasonality).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the level and noise components are fundamental to any time series analysis, while trend and seasonality are additional components that may or may not be present, depending on the nature of the data being analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: A **cyclic time series** is a time series that exhibits repeating patterns that are not of a fixed frequency. For example, a time series that exhibits a cycle of length 12 months but with varying amplitude or frequency would be considered cyclic rather than seasonal. Cyclic patterns are often more difficult to model and forecast than seasonal patterns because they do not have a fixed frequency or amplitude."

    "__Additive__ and __multiplicative__ are two different types of time series models that can be used to describe and forecast data patterns over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **additive time series model** assumes that the value of the series at any given time is the sum of the components of the series, which are typically the trend, seasonal variation, and residual (error) terms. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n",

    "- - In the cases where the cyclic component is distinguishable, it can be added to the model as well $y(t) = Trend + Seasonality + Cycle + Error$. The cyclical component can be associated to, e.g., the business cycle, which is a recurring pattern of economic expansion and contraction that occurs over time.\n",

    "Time series analysis is a powerful technique that can be used to make predictions about future values of a variable based on its past values or in the detection of outliers/anomalies/novelties. In this context, there are many applications of time series analysis in a variety of industries, including finance, economics, marketing, and engineering, among others. Here are some examples of time series forecasting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stock prices**: Predicting future stock prices based on historical data can be a challenging task, but it is one of the most popular use cases for time series forecasting. Investors and traders often use time series models to forecast stock prices and make better investment decisions.\n",
