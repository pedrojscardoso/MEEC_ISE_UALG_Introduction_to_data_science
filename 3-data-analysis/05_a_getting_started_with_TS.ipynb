    "where $x_i$ represents the observation at the $i$-th time interval and $n$ is the total number of observations. The time interval can be defined as the interval between two consecutive observations, such as seconds, minutes, days, weeks, months, years etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the mathematical definition of a time series can be represented as a function $X(t)$ that maps each time point $t$ to a corresponding observation $x_t$. Thus, a time series can be written as:\n",

For instance, $t-1$ represents the previous time and $t-2$ represents the prior time. $x_{t-1}$ (sames as $X(t-1)$) and $x_{t-2}$ (same as $X(t-2)$) are the observations for these periods, respectively. We are interested in predicting future times. For instance, the following time is $t+1$ and the following time is $t+2$. $x_{t+1} = X(t+1)$ and $x_{t+2} = X(t+2)$, respectively, represent the observations at these times.\n",

    "- __Sequence__: a TS is a collection of data points. Each data point can have multiple value, although most of the time it is a single value (usually a binary, an integer, or a real value).\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Discrete__: Although the phenomena measured by a system can be continuous (for example, the outside temperature is a continuous variable because time can \"span the entire real number line\"), TS data is generated by systems that capture data points at specific intervals (for instance, a temperature sensor can take a new temperature reading every 5 minutes). The measurement interval is usually regular (the data points are evenly spaced in time), but they are frequently irregular.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Chronologically__: The data points are naturally ordered in time. If you analyze your TS data, in almost all cases, you will notice that data points that are close together in time are more closely related than observations that are further apart. Because of this natural ordering, any time series model will typically attempt to learn from past values of a given sequence."

    "\n",
    "Time series analysis offers a collection of methods for comprehending a dataset better. Perhaps the of the most beneficial way to analyze a time series is to decompose it into its four key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The __level__ component represents the series' starting point if it followed a straight line trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The __trend__ component describes the series' potentially linear, variable, increasing, or decreasing behavior over time.\n",

    "The **trend and seasonality are optional, and all time series have a level and noise**, i.e., not all time series have a clear trend or seasonality. Some time series may have a stable level and show no trend or seasonality at all. Similarly, the level and noise components are present in almost all time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **level component** represents the baseline or starting point of the series, while the **noise component** captures the random variation or fluctuations in the data that cannot be attributed to any of the other components (such as trend or seasonality).\n",

    "### Additive and multiplicative time series\n",
    "\n",
    "__Additive__ and __multiplicative__ are two different types of time series models that can be used to describe and forecast data patterns over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **additive time series model** assumes that the value of the series at any given time is the sum of the components of the series, which are typically the trend, seasonal variation, and residual (error) terms. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$y(t) = Trend + Seasonality + Error,$$\n",
    "where $y(t)$ is the value of the series at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additive models are often used when the magnitude of the seasonal variation is relatively constant over time, and the fluctuations in the series are relatively small compared to the overall level of the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a **multiplicative time series model** assumes that the value of the series at any given time is the product of the components of the series, which are typically the trend, seasonal variation, and residual (error) terms. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$y(t) = Trend \\times Seasonality \\times Error$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplicative models are often used when the magnitude of the seasonal variation changes over time, and the fluctuations in the series are proportional to the overall level of the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the choice between additive and multiplicative models depends on the specific characteristics of the time series data being analyzed, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer. It is important to carefully examine the patterns and characteristics of the data and choose the model that best captures the underlying dynamics of the series."

    "#### Univariate time series forecasting\n",
    "- __Univariate time series forecasting__ refers to the process of predicting future values of a __single variable over time__, based on its past values. In other words, it involves analyzing a time series dataset that contains only one variable and using it to make predictions about its future behavior. Univariate time series forecasting methods typically involve identifying the underlying patterns or components of the time series, such as trend, seasonality, and noise, and then using statistical models to make predictions about future values based on these patterns. Some common univariate time series forecasting techniques include exponential smoothing, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, and seasonal decomposition of time series models. These methods can be used to make short-term or long-term forecasts, depending on the nature of the data and the forecasting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, predicting the daily closing price of a stock based on its past prices is a univariate time series forecasting problem. In this case, the time series dataset contains only one variable (the daily closing price of the stock) and the goal is to predict its future values based on its past values."

In other words, it involves analyzing a time series dataset that contains multiple variables and using them together to make predictions about their future behavior. Multivariate time series forecasting methods typically involve identifying the underlying patterns or components of the time series for each variable, such as trend, seasonality, and noise, and then using statistical models that can account for the __interactions among these variables to make joint predictions about their future behavior__. Some common multivariate time series forecasting techniques include vector autoregression (VAR) models, dynamic factor models, and neural network models. These methods also can be used to make short-term or long-term forecasts, depending on the nature of the data and the forecasting problem. Multivariate time series forecasting is often used in fields such as economics, finance, and environmental science, where multiple variables are known to interact and influence each other over time.\n",

In this case, the time series dataset contains multiple variables (the daily closing prices of the stocks) and the goal is to predict their future values based on their past values and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, __exogenous variables__ are external variables that are not part of the time series being analyzed, but are believed to have an influence on the dependent variable in the time series. In other words, exogenous variables are considered to be factors that are outside of the system being modeled but still impact the outcome of the system. In time series analysis, exogenous variables are often included in the model as additional predictors or inputs to improve the accuracy of the forecast.\n",

    "\n",
    "- What is the appropriate forecasting horizon for the problem at hand, and what level of accuracy is required for the forecasted values?\n",
    "\n",
    "- How much data do you have at your disposal, and can you compile it all?\n",

    "- __Irregular time series__: An irregular time series is a type of time series that does not exhibit any specific patterns or trends, and the data appears to be random or unpredictable. Irregular time series are often observed in data that is subject to random noise or measurement errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Event time series__: An event time series is a type of time series that represents the occurrence or frequency of specific events over time.\n",
