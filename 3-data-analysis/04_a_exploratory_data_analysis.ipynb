    "Now that we have the fundamental knowledge about Python and in particular Pandas we can start to do some exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA is the first step in the data science process and it is very important to understand the data that we are working with. EDA is used by data scientists to understand the data, to identify patterns, to spot anomalies, to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.\n",

In 1912, during its maiden voyage, the widely considered \"unsinkable\" RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n",

    "- What is the distribution of the passengers by age?\n",

    "\n",
    "Data types are fundamental concepts in statistical  analysis, being divided into the following main categories:\n",
    "- **Nominal attributes** refer to variables that are categorized by names or labels. These variables have categorical, qualitative, and unordered values, such as brand names, product names, zip codes, gender, or marital status. The value of a nominal attribute can be represented by the symbol or name of an item. It is not meaningful to calculate the mean or median values for nominal attributes, but data analysts can calculate the mode, which is the value that appears most frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ordinal attributes** are variables that have names or labels with a meaningful order or ranking, but their exact magnitude is unknown. These attributes measure subjective qualities, which make them ideal for surveys that collect information on customer satisfaction, product ratings, and movie reviews. For example, customer satisfaction ratings may range from very dissatisfied to very satisfied, or the size of a drink may be classified as small, medium, or large. The median and mode are the only measures of central tendency that should  be used for ordinal attributes, as the mean cannot be calculated due to their qualitative nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numeric attributes** are variables that are quantitatively represented as either integer or real values. For example, the number of children in a family is a numeric attribute. The mean, median, and mode are all appropriate measures of central tendency for numeric attributes.\n",

    "#### Discrete and continuous variables\n",

    "Variables can be divided into two main categories:\n",
    "- **discrete variables** are variables that can take on only a finite number of values. For example, the number of children in a family is a discrete variable, as it can only take on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.\n",
